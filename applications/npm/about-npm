 Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
 
 This is a transitional script needed to install "nodejs".
 
 Once installed using AppMan, symlinks from /opt/bin/nodejs will be
 shown in /opt/bin (node, npm, npx and corepack) along with a script
 named "npm-programs", needed to load new links each time a new
 program installed with NodeJS tools.
  
 REMOVE: appman -r nodejs (this removes NodeJS and all its related programs).
