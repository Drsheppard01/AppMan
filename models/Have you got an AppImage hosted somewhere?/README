The folder SAMPLE must contain:

  1) SAMPLE-installer (this is the installation script);

  2) about-SAMPLE (it is a brief description);

  3) SAMPLE.svg (this is the icon of the application in SVG format).
  
Replace the word SAMPLE with the name of the command you want to call the app.

For example:
 - use the word "firefox", and NOT "Firefox" or "FireFox";
 - use the words "your-app", and NOT "Your App" or "Your-app" or "Your-APP" etcetera etcetera.

The guidelines are already #commented in the /SAMPLE/SAMPLE-installer file.

Have fun!
